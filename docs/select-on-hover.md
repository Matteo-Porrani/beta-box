# New select UI component

I need a new select UI component that shows options on hover.

I will use it to replace the current select in TodoBoard.vue

![select](images/select-on-hover-replace.png)

The desired behavior is to show options on hover.
Then I'll just click on an option to select it.

You should implement the new component in src/modules/ui/components/BxHoverSelect.vue

using Composition API and Tailwind CSS
